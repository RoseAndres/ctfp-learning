# Learning UIUA

## the GOAL
  The algorithm has been suggesting Category Theory (CT) to me for quite a while and a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC1EiX5bM0) led me down a short rabbit hole that ended in me wanting to learn about CT and Array Languages (ALs).

As such the following are my goals with this project:
  - Read "Category Theory for Programmers" (CTfP), via the [original blogpost series](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/
) by Bartosz Milewski
  - Learn about and play around with [UIUA](https://www.uiua.org/), a stack-oriented array programming language

## CTfP Lesson Notes + Challenge Answers
Below is a list of all of my notes as well as my answers to the end of post challenges. My current favorite language is Ruby, so all of my answers will be written as such!

### [Part One](part-one)
  1. [Category: The Essence of Composition](part-one/category-the-essence-of-composition.md)
